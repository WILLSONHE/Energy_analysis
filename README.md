Task 1 Making a History Table
Create a list of Regex search and replaces that reduces the text captured with a select-all copy from the site https://www.livescience.com/20718-computer-history.html and turns it into a tab separated file with two columns: a year (4 digits) and a truncated blurb of the first most 80 characters 
Task 2 Getting Data on Energy
Create an Excel file with of the total energy produced/consumed per year from the full data set contained in the page.
https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption
in the same page add the column of the years from Task1 and use the LOOKUP function to “look up” your total energy produced/consumed for that year. Which year’s value did it use for 1801? What is the text of your formula?  To put this in a cell: go to a new cell type the single quote ‘ and start typing. In this case it would be ‘=LOOKUP (…
Task 3 Getting Data on GDP
Download the full data from the site below (nearly 20000 rows) and open it into an Excel spreadsheet
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-maddison-2020
Calculate minimum and maximum for the years column. How many entries are there for the minimum and maximum year? What does that mean about this data set?
In the same page add the column of the years from Task1 and use the and the function SUMIFS to calculate the total GDP for each year. What is the text of your formula?  
Task 4 Combining the Data
Make a new Excel file called Asn1_YourLogin.xlsx (for instance for me it would be Asn1_jmorey2.xlsx). Create a single table with 4 columns: the 2 columns from task 1, the computed column from task2, and the compute column from task 3. Remember to use “paste values” so that your files don’t link with this new file. Create appropriate headers for the columns.
Underneath the table include a two-column table with the headers search and replace.  Fill in the sequence of search and replaces you used in Task 1.  Put the written answers for the tasks underneath the search and replace table. Clearly indicate which task your written answers come from.
Insert a column before the 4th column and calculate the percentage change for column 3: (new value minus old value) over old value. Change the column so that it is displayed as a percent. Also, calculate the percentage change for column 5 (which used to be column 4).  Change the colour of an entry in column 2 for any percentage changes over 9% in either percent change column. Describe how might the events of computer history might affect GDP or Energy consumption?
Task 5 Correlation?
Compute the correlation among the three numeric columns. Are these strong correlations? What do they mean? 
In general, describe possible issues with the data in your table. 
Aside from the data, which of the computer history entries was the most interesting and why?
